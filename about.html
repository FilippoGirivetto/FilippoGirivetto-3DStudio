    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I've always been passionate about visual arts, from sketching to photography and cinema. I am a self-taught 3D artist, having learned Blender on my own, and have honed my skills over the years. I specialize in 3D modeling, motion graphics, and video editing, blending traditional artistic techniques with digital tools.</p>
    <p>Alongside my passion for art, I am constantly exploring the latest AI technologies and integrating them into my creative workflows, pushing the boundaries of my work. My aim is to combine art and innovation to bring new perspectives to every project I work on.</p>
